The City develops annually a Capital Investment Plan (CIP), which is a document that outlines capital projects for the next ten years, including infrastructure projects, building improvements, park redesigns, and equipment purchases. It also provides a proposed schedule and identifies financing options.

This version was submitted to the Board of Aldermen in January of 2016 and will be updated in late 2016.
